# @setar/audiomerging
a Promise-based Module for merging Audios

this module uses ffmpeg to connect every audios to eachother(at the back of the 1st or last music in the array)

there wouldn't be any kinda of docs or anything since this package is kinda made for personal uses, but you can feel free to make one by using jsdoc.
